<h2 id="welcome-to-the-fmlab">Welcome to the FMLab</h2>
<p>Hello I am Florian.</p>
<p>This document, <strong>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Markowetz lab</strong>, describes our
‘lab culture’, the way we do things. I started writing it a few years after
starting this lab, because I wanted new team members -like you- to have the best
possible start in the lab.</p>
<p>Every lab, every human community, has rules and expectations that are often
implied and un-spoken. As a new team member you might be unsure how things work
and what is expected of you. This is why I will try to be explicit about what I
expect of you and what you can expect of me.</p>
<p>In this first chapter I will introduce some of the core ideas, before the next
chapters (which were written by different groups of team members) go into more
details and specifics.!</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong></p>
<p><strong>We build technologies for doctors to make better decisions faster!</strong></p>
<p>This means: our group is medical oriented, vary applied (a.k.a.
"translational"), and that we take on projects that have a clear path to
real-world impact. On the flip side, we do relatively little fundamental or
'blue sky' research.</p>
<p>The sucess of our lab is built in shared <strong>core values:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - we work in a close scientific network and we contribute
proactively to all collaborations;</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong> - we do things differently -better, we think- and our
approaches and questions are unique; we don’t just do what everyone else is
doing;</li>
<li><strong>Generosity</strong> - we are generous with time and support. We help each other and
collaborators (without, say, immediately asking for an authorship in
return);</li>
<li><strong>People over projects</strong>- we shape the project to fit your strengths and
ideas;</li>
<li><strong>Rigour</strong>- we do things right. We walk the extra mile. If it looks like more
work it probably is the right thing to do;</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>- we share code, drafts, data, and any other information
freely inside and outside the group. We talk openly about your plans and
projects;</li>
</ul>
<p>When you work with me, this is <strong>what you can expect from me</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I see this group as an incubator for your success and I will teach you the
skills you need for your career.</li>
<li>I will do my best to adapt my style to your needs and personality.</li>
<li>I play with open cards and will discuss any issues with you as soon as they
arise.</li>
<li>I will work with you to define your project and adapt it to your strengths and
ideas - even finding you a new one, if the first one doesn’t really fit.</li>
<li>I will design your project to be fully yours - there will never be another
person competing with you on the same project.</li>
<li>I will support you regardless of your career choice: you will not be treated
differently whether you want a career in science or industry or start-up or
policy or sci comm.</li>
<li>I will be available to meet with you and you have different options how to
chat:<ol>
<li>There are weekly group and team meetings for more technical
  discussions.</li>
<li>Every 6 months we will have a 1-to-1 strategy meeting, where
   take a bird-s-eye view of how things are going and the dynamics in the
lab.</li>
<li type="a">You can always knock on my door or schedule a meeting through my
PA Sabina.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong>what I expect from you</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You show initiative at the right level: You don’t wait until you are told, but
you also don’t go rogue - rather, you proactively come up with ideas and at
the same time keep me in the loop throughout the process. Particular areas
of initiative are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You own your project. You take leadership in it and shape its direction
with your ideas.</li>
<li>You are an active contributor to our lab meetings and the institute
meetings, delivering presentations and contributing to the discussions.</li>
<li>You take an interest in the other team members and generously help them
if you can.</li>
<li>You use the training opportunities the institute/uni has for you.</li>
<li>You build your own network with other scientists at the institute and the
wider Cambridge community.</li>
<li>You participate to this group beyond its research (eg by planning a lab
retreat).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I expect you to read widely and know your field inside-out. I expect you to
think about the impact your project can have on the field and to focus your
efforts on key central problems rather than marginal improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You embrace ”The Beach”. Our lab is a beach: a place where the dry meets the
wet - cheesy, I know. You learn the skills to effectively communicate with ‘the
other side’ and use your skills to help them with their problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You manage upwards. You speak about your needs and how I can help you best.
You make yourself heard even when I look busy (don’t be afraid to knock on my
door or schedule a meeting through Sabina). It you think that I am unaware of an
important issue in the lab, please tell me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p>
<p>This document is part of a larger collection I would like you to read and think
about:</p>
<ol>
<li>My paper <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004387">’You are not working for me; I am working with you’</a>, which
tells you more about how the lab started und my first experiences leading a
team. The lab has changed over time, but you will see that the core is still the
same.</li>
<li>My paper <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7">‘Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly’</a>, which focuses on
one of the key beliefs of our lab - that science is better if it is transparent
and code/date are shared freely and widely.</li>
<li>My blog post <a href="https://scientificbsides.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/why-science-needs-continuous-leadership-support">’Why science needs continuous leadership support’</a>, which
contains some of my general ideas on leadership and the different perspectives
different lab members have.</li>
<li>Kearns and Gardiner, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7331-570a">’The care and maintenance of your supervisor’</a>,
which should drive home the message that I need you to be an active participant
in our partnership.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of these ideas resonate with you?
What do you think is surprising?
Where would you like to learn more details?
What other expectations/wishes/dreams/plans do you have?
What do you disagree with?</p>
<p>We will discuss these questions in a 1-1 meeting that will happen about 4 weeks
after you joined the lab. In this meeting, we will also cover how your start in
the lab was, what support you need, how your project looks like and what the
first steps will be.</p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
<h3 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h3>
<p>To help you get started, we have compiled a list of essential resources and
information for. This quick start guide includes links to get up and running.
The rest of the handbook contains more detailed sections on lab expectations,
communication policies, lab meetings/notebooks, ordering policies, details on
our lab philosophy and general policies. You aren't expected to read everything,
just when its relevant to you.</p>
